# Matheus Affonso | Web Dev

This is my personal portfolio. You can check the live version [here](https://matheusaffonso.me).

I developed it with React, making use of the context API to manage state (mostly responsible to select the website's language and to define the state of the modal). The project is hosted on Netlify.
